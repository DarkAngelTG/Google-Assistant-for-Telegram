# I registered my device and got my bot token, what now?
Replace ```YOUR_ID``` with your own ID and ```YOUR_TOKEN``` with the token of the bot.

# How do I start it?
Simply run ```python3 telegramassistant.py --device-id YOUR_DEVICE_ID --device-model-id YOUR_DEVICE_MODEL_ID```
Make sure to replace ```YOUR_DEVICE_ID``` and ```YOUR_MODEL_ID``` with your own. It will not work without it.
